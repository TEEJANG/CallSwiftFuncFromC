# JSON Schema Validation


A JSON schema validator that builds on the JSON implementation found in [fost-base](https://github.com/KayEss/fost-base) and is built for use in [Fostgres](https://github.com/KayEss/fostgres). It is implemented in modern C++, specifically C++17.


## Assertions

The specifications for them are taken from [_JSON Schema Validation: A Vocabulary for Structural Validation of JSON_ (draft 1)](https://www.ietf.org/id/draft-handrews-json-schema-validation-01.txt). All of described assertions are implemented:

* `allOf`, `anyOf` and `oneOf` -- Values must conform to a specific number of the provided schemas.
* `const` -- Values must be equal to the one in the schema.
* `contains` -- At least one value in an array conforms to the schema.
* `dependencies` -- Object property checks depending on which exist in the data.
* `enum` -- Values must be in the specified set.
* `if`, `then` and `else` -- conditional evaluation of schemas.
* `items` and `additionalItems`-- Array items must confirm to the provided schemas.
* `maximum`, `minimum`, `exclusiveMaximum`, `exlusiveMinimum`, `multipleOf` -- Value bounds checks for numeric data.
* `maxItems` and `minItems` -- bounds for the number of items in a JSON array.
* `maxLength` and `minLength` -- bounds for the number of code points in a string value.
* `maxProperties` and `minProperties` -- counts for properties in a JSON object.
* `not` -- negates the contained check.
* `pattern` -- The regex must be found in a string value.
* `properties`, `patternProperties` and `additionalProperties` -- that the assertions for each property hold if present in the JSON object data.
* `propertyNames` -- names of object properties must conform to the provided schema.
* `required` -- Object properties must include the specified strings.
* `type` -- type check against the JSON types (`null`, `boolean`, `object`, `array`, `number`, `string` and `integer`).
* `uniqueItems` -- All values in an array are unique.

The schema used for testing is <http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#>.


### Notes

For type validation, if the underlying memory type is a `double` then it will only match against `number` even if there is no fractional part to the number. The JSON parser will correctly identify integers parsing JSON (and use the `int64_t` memory type for them), so this can only happen when JSON is produced by code that uses a `double`. The memory type `int64_t` will match both of the `number` and `integer` validation types.

The handling of `$id` is particularly nasty. Although this implementation passes the test suite there are a large number of edge cases with the interactions between `$ref` and `$id` that are not tested or covered. Our recommendation is to avoid use of `$id` except for a full URL at schema root if required.


## The JSON Schema Testsuite

The build target `json-schema-testsuite` will download and run the tests that are found at the [_JSON Schema Test Suite_](https://github.com/json-schema-org/JSON-Schema-Test-Suite/tree/master/tests/draft7).
