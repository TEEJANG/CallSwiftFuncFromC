   contains a number of foundation sub-libraries.

    \ingroup fost_core

    \brief Used to load shared objects or DLLs at runtime.

    There are separate implementations of this class for Windows and for
   Linux/Mac OSX due to platform differences. On all platforms the dynlib
   instance assures that the library is loaded into memory and is properly
   initialised.

    In all implementations the destructor does not actually attempt to unload
   the library. It uses fostlib::atexit() to unload the library when the process
   terminates. Without this the management of the lifetimes of objects whose
   code is loaded in the library must be carefully managed so that they are all
   deleted before the library is unloaded.

    <b>Note that fost/core must be included before this header.</b> I.e.:
    <pre class="language-cpp">
    \#include <fost/core>
    \#include <fost/dynlib.hpp>
    </pre>

    \section windows Windows notes

    The Windows implementation makes use of LoadLibraryW so the name does not
   need to be complete, nor does it need an extension.

    The library is never unloaded as Windows will take care of this properly as
   the process terminates.

    \section unix Linux and Mac notes

    The library name must include the full file name, but not a path.
